We strive to deliver high-quality freelance software development services that meet our clients' expectations. This Refunds Policy outlines the circumstances under which refunds may be granted.

## 1. General Policy

Due to the nature of our services—custom and client-specific software development—all sales are generally considered final. However, we understand that there may be exceptional situations that require review.

## 2. Eligibility for Refunds

Refunds may be considered under the following conditions:

- **Work Not Started:** If the project has not been started and no work has been delivered, a full refund may be issued.
- **Client Cancellation:** If a client cancels the project after work has begun, a partial refund may be granted based on the percentage of work completed.

## 3. Non-Refundable Items

- Payments made for completed work or milestones already delivered and approved.
- Services where substantial time and resources have already been invested.
- Delays or dissatisfaction arising from incomplete client input, changing requirements, or third-party dependencies.

## 4. Refund Process

To request a refund, please contact us with:

- Your full name and contact information
- Project details (including invoice number, if applicable)
- A detailed explanation of the reason for the refund request
