Hello! My name is *Mohamed Hichem Fendali*. I'm a Designer & Software Engineer from Dr√©an, Algeria and this is my personal playground.

Among other things, I'm currently a co-founder & manager of [Pinnovate](https://pinnovate.io), the team behind [Coursella](https://www.coursella.com) LMS.

Interested in many things dealing with digital bits and colors, I often do *UI/UX Design*, *Front-end developement* and *Full-stack developement*. You can find my design work on [Behance](https://behance.net/hfend), my resume on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mhfendali) and my occasional musings on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_hfend) and this website.

Feel like saying hi? Send me a message on [simplizine@gmail.com](mailto:simplizine@gmail.com) or hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_hfend). I'd love to chat.

Thanks!
